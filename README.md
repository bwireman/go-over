A tool to audit Erlang & Elixir dependencies, to make sure your ✨ gleam
projects really sparkle!

🚨 _**NOTE**_: security advisories are _NOT_ currently monitored for gleam
dependencies. The language, while excellent, is far too new and niche.

⚠️ Dependencies sourced directly from git or locally have limited support, only
checking for security advisories and not retirements or outdated versions

# 🔽 Install

```sh
gleam add --dev go_over
```

## 📣 Also!

- add `.go-over/` to your `.gitignore`
- make sure `git` is installed. (If not running via the BEAM you need `curl`,
  `wget` _or_ `httpie` installed as well)

#### 🌸 Javascript

If running with Javascript install

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "yaml": "^2.4.3"
  }
}
```

Bun, Deno & Nodejs are _all_ supported!

# ▶️ Usage

```sh
gleam run -m go_over
```

### 🎥 Obligatory VHS

![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bwireman/go-over/main/images/demo.gif)

### 🏴 Flags

- `--format` Specify the output format of any warnings, [minimal, verbose, json]
  (default: None)
- `--puller` Specify the tool used to reach out to hex.pm, [native, curl, wget,
  httpie] (default: None)
- `--force`: Force pulling new data even if the cached data is still valid
- `--outdated`: Additionally check if newer versions of dependencies exist
- `--ignore-indirect`: Ignore all warnings for indirect dependencies
- `--verbose`: Print progress as packages are checked
- `--help,-h`: Print help

Flags override config values if set

### ⚙️ Config

Optional settings that can be added to your project's `gleam.toml`

```toml
[go-over]
# disables caching if false
# default: true
cache = true
# if true all cached data will be stored in user's home directory
# allowing cache to be shared between projects
# default: true
global = true
# sets output format for warnings ["minimal", "detailed", "json"]
# default: "minimal"
format = "minimal"
# will additionally check if newer versions of dependencies exist
# default: true
outdated = true
# tool used to pull information from hex.pm ["native", "curl", "wget", "httpie"]
# default: "curl" for JS and "native" for Erlang
puller = "curl"
# licenses dependencies are allowed to use. If left empty then all licenses are allowed
# default: []
allowed_licenses = []

[go-over.ignore]
# will ignore all warnings for indirect dependencies
# default: false
indirect = false
# will ignore all warnings for dev-dependencies. Note: to ignore indirect dependencies regardless of source see go-over.ignore.indirect
# default: false
dev_dependencies = false
# list of package names to skip when auditing dependencies
# default: []
packages = ["example_package"]
# list of warning severities to skip when auditing dependencies
# default: []
# (case insensitive)
severity = ["example_moderate"]
# list of advisory IDs to skip when auditing dependencies
# default: []
ids = ["GHSA-xxxx-yyyy-zzzz"]
```

### ⌛ Caching

- Security advisory data is cached for **_six_** hours
- hex.pm retired package data is cached for **_one_** hour

## 🪝 pre-commit hooks

You can add go_over to you're pre-commit hooks by installing
[🌵cactus](https://hex.pm/packages/cactus) & then adding this to your
`gleam.toml`

```toml
[cactus.pre-commit]
actions = [
  { command = "go_over" },
]
```

## ⚙️ CI

You can also schedule daily runs to keep your deps up to date and open issues
when necessary!
